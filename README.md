# work-with-EWI â€“ Outreach Landing Page

This is a quick-loading, no-BS landing page built for cold outreach campaigns.  
Itâ€™s designed to give prospects a fast overview of what we do and why it matters â€” without sending them to a bloated corporate site.

###  Tech Used:
- HTML & CSS (vanilla, lightweight)
- Hosted via GitHub Pages
- Mobile-responsive

###  Use Case:
We send this as a link in our email outreach to plant managers, EHS directors, and project engineers in industrial settings.  
It works especially well when you're trying to build trust and stand out from templated spam.

###  Demo
 â€” replace with your live link
